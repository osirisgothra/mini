mini/eso-bin

personal, esoteric scripts

the scripts contained herin are esoteric as in public need-for-use. unless you are the author, I doubt you would have much use for it, without alteration. If you do use it you will probably want to discect it and I make no guarentees about what it does -- for all I know, it could erase your entire disk, flash your BIOS to blank and unrecoverable, get you banned from EFNET... not my fault!

usage: at own risk; link to ~/bin, or (if already have on) link all files into existing ~/bin.

note: user name, filesystem config, and, distro (uname -a) are not checked at all, and rely on a normal sudo-enabled user at UID 1000.
