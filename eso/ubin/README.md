 You probably dont want to bother reading this, find
 a repo that is of a more interesting nature.

personal, esoteric scripts
--------------------------

the scripts contained herin are esoteric as in public need-for-use. unless you are 
the author, I doubt you would have much use for it, without alteration. 
If you do use it you will probably want to discect it and I make no guarentees 
about what it does -- 
    for all I know, it could erase your entire disk, 
    flash your BIOS to blank and unrecoverable, 
    get you banned from EFNET... not my fault!
