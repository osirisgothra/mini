#    HISTORY
#
#	 Sat 25 Jul 2020 01:30:11 PM EDT
#            osirisgothra@ initially created this file
#            with the original name, .shrc
#
#	  INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
#
#
#		To install, link it to a nonexisting '.shrc' in your home like this:
#			ln -s /usr/src/fundashable ~/.shrc
#		To use, include it as your startup in your .profile, it should also
#		work with bash, ash, dash, zsh, and the like however it is INTENDED for sh:
#			nano ~/.profile
#			--------------------------------
#			# .profile file
#			# addded these lines for fundashable, you might want to check which shell is running though if you have
#			# shells that also read .profile
#			# admins/home users: do NOT use /etc/profile! that would be a major security risk!!
#			#					 do not use SUID or the like, for the same reasons above
#			#					 do not use ENV as it has been reportedly unstable and insecure!
#			if [ -r ~/.shrc ]; then
#				. ~/.shrc
#			fi
