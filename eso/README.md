mini/eso-bin
============

4-04-2020

ubin-local	once was /usr/bin/local scripts changed by me,
		plus some of my own. It now is ONLY items belonging
		to me for LICENSE consistency purposes. Modified items
		that may remain do so unknowingly and will be removed
		as they are found. This directory now refers to
		the very personal ~/bin instead.

ubin		as above, except there are far less left behind here
		and also, this is compeltely discontinued and soon to
		be no more. For the time being it is read-only.

 You probably dont want to bother reading this, find
 a repo that is of a more interesting nature.

personal, esoteric scripts
--------------------------

the scripts contained herin are esoteric as in public need-for-use. unless you are 
the author, I doubt you would have much use for it, without alteration. 
If you do use it you will probably want to discect it and I make no guarentees 
about what it does -- 
    for all I know, it could erase your entire disk, 
    flash your BIOS to blank and unrecoverable, 
    get you banned from EFNET... not my fault!
