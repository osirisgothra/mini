about /usr/local/bin/vim [binary]:
originates from /src/fork/vim/src/g?vi(ew|m|mdiff)
not all binaries possibly generated by the above regex origin string (rxs) are created
see the binaries in the original dir for actual names that match the rxs
when recompiling, use /src/fork/vim, and use 'configure' if need be
and then use 'make' followed by 'make install'
sudo should be needed if running as user other than root
