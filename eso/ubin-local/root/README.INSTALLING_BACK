[ Installing Into System ]

The contents of this directory should be COPIED via symlink
to their new homes, keeping this one off to the side, this way
the .gitignore does not have to work so hard. This ignore file
is only for the original context, and wont cover destination
systems. Plus, the gitignore is subject to changes as the home
directories in which these files reside change. In other words:

DO NOT REPLACE YOUR /usr/local/bin WITH THIS DIRECTORY!
