 ubin-local
 local esoteric projects and scripts
 2013-2020
 files that date before 2013 follow the GNU GPL v1
 files that date prior to 2000 follow their own specific licenses
 files that date prior to 1997 are considered to be private and are
 not for reuse. if you come across anything like this, I need to be
 notified (osirisgothra@hotmail.com) as I have been doing this archive
 for quite a long time (from ~1992 on, 28 years give or take). I have
 tried to keep the older files out but some may still be here. You can
 find any of my PUBLIC older stuff on walnut creek which was managed by
 UC Berkley but is now a private archive managed by companies such as
 simtel, twbm, oldnet, funet, etc. Those sites have mirrored my work and
 have on archive their own licenses that pertain to only that material,
 not to my work in general. 

 LICENSE

 This submodule is '/mini/eso/ubin-local', which is meant for esoteric
 scripts that are used personally by the author in day-to-day operations.
 Also some entertainment stuff is rolled in there, you will most likely
 not find most of this stuff useful as it is very specific in purpose however
 I do try to make things portable (machine, not OS) whenever possible. As
 a general rule, locations of files, user names, etc are not hardwired if
 I can help it. If it CANT be helped, usually these values can simply be
 changed inline with a text editor. However, I here and now declare that none
 of the esoteric projects have any kind of guarentee of working for anyone
 else regardless of use, intent, etc. Most of this code licenses under the
 GNU GPL2 just for legal reasons. Individual files may have license restrictions
 IF THEY CONTAIN THEIR OWN LICENSE TEXT.

PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE LICENSE AND YOU SHOULD READ THE
GNU GPL2 YOURSELF ON THEIR WEBSITE AT: http://gpl.gnu.org

THIS FILE COVERS ITEMS IN THIS BRANCH, OTHER BRANCHES MAY HAVE THEIR OWN
LICENSE TEXTS, IF THEY DO YOU MUST READ THOSE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION!
