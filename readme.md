This project is for smaller projects that do not need their own repository. Most of these are esoteric to the author in nature, but are offered for historical or educational purposes. Many of these indicate and/or include their license within the header text. When this is not the case, the fallback license is the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0">GNU GPL v3.0</a> license
