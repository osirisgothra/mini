What is this 'eso' directory, it looks confusing?


This is my esoteric script collection. In other words, only certain people will want or need
them, however, they are "important" enough that I decided to keep them here. Also, they are
small enough that it isn't a waste of space to do so.

No documentation is further given about this directory, just look for yourself.
