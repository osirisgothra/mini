desc: TEMPLATE FILES that I use, also my ~/Templates, and mainly used by and for the 'snip' or 'snip-it' program
      (you can find snip (going from here: ../eso/ubin-local/snip)
      (for more info on esoteric projects, read ../eso/ubin-local/README.md)
      These files are updated several times a year but are not guarenteed to be up to date every time since I do
      not keep active changes here (this is not the master, but a copy of master, its stored on a private server)

  Templates here are subject to as-is and are PUBLIC DOMAIN whenever your location allows it to be
  For others who cant have public domain (why?) can just think of it as the most free LICENSE you /can/ use
  (or if your country is a real jerk about such things, just throw it in to the LGPL 3.0 or the share-alike,
   or wtfpl, etc, whatever)

   Stop Criminals From Taking Advantage of the Elderly

   Always Report Scams [ Regardless of any threads you may get for doing so, No, They wont be putting a 
   hitman on you, those cost lots of money and scammers, they dont spend money, they take money and would
   never go out of there way to spend the thousands of dollars it would take to silence one measly person ]
   Scammers deal in ScareWare, dont let them!  The Elderly and Handicapped are the top 90% being scammed,
   help make it stop, dont answer scam calls by voice, that is an admission of a 'live' line, and then can be
   sold for more money to other scammers. Never give out ANY info. Companies NEVER ask for money and personal
   information over the phone, this is dont in person or legitamate means like snail-mail. Warranty holders do
   not call you just before they run out (they dont want you to know you can renew them, sheesh come on guys!)

   DO NOT ANSWER SCAM LIKELY CALLS

   THE IRS NEVER CALLS YOU EVER

   YOUR CAR WARRANTY OFFICE NEVER CALLS EVER      
   
   UNEMPLOYMENT DOES NOT REQUIRE YOU TO PAY MONEY
   
   WARRANTY HOLDERS CANT PAY MONEY TO EXTEND THE WARRANTY
